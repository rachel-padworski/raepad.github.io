Teaching music to children was an exciting career - I taught band, orchestra, private lessons, K-3 classroom music, and I even started my own business, Mile High Academy of Music, LLC. I organized recitals and summer camps. I was the marketing director, head of HR, head of payroll, and Mrs. DoItAll. After six years of teaching I was burnt out! I was expecting my first child and wanted to be a stay at home mom. With the promise of full day kindergarten approaching I realized I wanted to start working again. About two years ago, a friend (who does backend engineering with Google) invited me to a trial class at Turing School. I thought I'd have a hard time wrapping my brain around coding, but I actually enjoyed myself!! I started learning on FreeCodeCamp.org and CodeCademy.com. I taught myself the basics of CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Ruby. Flatiron School's part-time remote program is perfect for my family (my kids are 1 and 4 and aren't in daycare or school). I am very excited for this new journey and to see where it will take me! Here's to new beginnings.
